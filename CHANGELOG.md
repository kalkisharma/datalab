# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — Phase 1 MVP

First usable release. Open `datalab.html` in any browser — no server, no install, no internet.

### Features
- Drag-drop N CSV datasets, each with editable name and palette color
- Series editor modal: dataset picker, chart type, adaptive per-type fields
- Chart types: scatter, line, parity
- Parity plots: inner join on key across two datasets, y=x line, ±5%/±10%
  error bands, NSE/MAE/RMSE annotation, equal axis ranges enforced
- AND-only filters per series: `=`, `≠`, `<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥`
- Style controls: colormap, marker size/opacity, edge color/width, gridlines
- Figure size and manual axis ranges
- Auto/locked plot title and axis labels
- Save plots with thumbnails, restore, delete; ZIP export; PNG download
- `beforeunload` guard against losing unsaved work

### Security
- CSP meta tag blocks all network access at the browser level
- All user strings escaped via `escHtml()` before DOM insertion
- 12-test Playwright XSS suite (5 insertion points × 2 payloads + CSP checks)
- Bundled library hashes verified at build time against `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- No localStorage/sessionStorage/cookies — session-only state

### Fixed during phase review
- Parity stats: x/y pairs with a one-sided non-finite value are now dropped
  together rather than independently filtered (which misaligned every
  subsequent pair and silently corrupted NSE/MAE/RMSE)

## Schema

### v0.1.0
- Initial schema, `version: 1`. Fields: `datasets[]`, `series[]`,
  `plotConfig`, `style`, `savedPlots[]`, `plotRendered`.
- Filter operators: `eq`, `neq`, `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte` (scalar values).
